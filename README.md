The primary objective of “AI-powered product review summarization” is to efficiently analyze large volumes of product reviews, estimating positive and negative sentiment specific to a product identified by its product_name. Using the TextBlob library for sentiment analysis and NLTK for summary generation, the tool increases the ease of analysis and simplifies decision-making processes for sellers and consumers. Desired outcomes include time investment, an informed customer base, and ultimately a reduction in the purchase of defective products. By categorizing sentiment and generating concise summaries, the tool equips users with valuable insights, streamlines the review analysis process, and contributes to a more efficient and trustworthy E-Commerce marketplace.
